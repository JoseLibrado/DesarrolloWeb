                        <p>Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.</p>

                            <p>African lions are considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. They are threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat. They are also killed by humans in bravery rituals, as hunting trophies, for medicinal powers, or by ranchers protecting their livestock. Furthermore, they are susceptible to tick-borne diseases like canine distemper and babesia. Distemper is spread to lions by neighboring village dogs as well as hyenas. Babesia occurs during droughts, when malnourished prey is vulnerable to disease. The ticks spread to the lions after they kill the sick animal. The combination of distemper and babesia causes mass fatalities in lion populations.</p>

                            <p>The lion cub that was found in a field near Tienhoven on Sunday had been offered to an animal sanctuary in Friesland on the preceding Friday, RTL Nieuws reports. The Stichting Viervoeters in Nijeberkoop was contacted by an anonymous caller and asked to pick up the animal in Utrecht. However, it could not take the cub in because it is against safety rules to take in unlicenced animals</p>

                        <p>Lions are often considered as fierce predators; King of the jungle." They have a mysterious majestic air that attracts people (usually to see them in a zoo or if you are lucky, on a wild safari).Lions in their natural habitat show a very similar behavior, especially when subordinate females or younger animals meet the most dominant lions in the herd. When a subordinate lion encounters a dominant lion, it lowers its head, raises its tail, and rubs its head against the other animal.</p>

                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for the former and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for the latter.</p>
